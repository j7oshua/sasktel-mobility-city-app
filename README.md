# City of PA - Sasktel Mobility APP

This project was created using React, Express JS, Node JS, and Microsoft SQL Server. The app was designed for CSV's to be
uploaded to the app that contained account #'s with cost totals for each account. Once the CSV is uploaded, the accounts
are mapped into departments with a complete total given for that department. This data is stored in the MSSQL db.

The app will display the total's for each month. Can also click each month to get a breakdown of total's for each department.
The app will allow new departments to be added and removed. The app will also allow mapping of phone numbers to accounts.
